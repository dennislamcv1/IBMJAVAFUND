Java remains one of the top four popular programming languages (TIOBE Index), and entry-level Java developers earn a good salary from the start, USD 86,000 annually on average!

Whether you're just starting your programming career or looking to add Java to your developer skillset, this beginner-friendly program builds the foundational skills you need to pursue a career in software development. As a vendor-neutral specialization designed and delivered by experts, it introduces you to modern Java programming techniques and gives you the opportunity to build real-world projects you can showcase to prospective employers.

Through hands-on labs, you’ll gain practical experience with Java fundamentals, including object-oriented programming (OOP), file handling, collections, and exception management. You'll also learn to write, debug, and structure code in a way that is maintainable and aligned with industry standards. The program then concludes with a project-based course that reinforces your skills through a professional-level build experience, where you’ll develop a shareable functional console-based Java application.

The program is designed for beginners; no prior programming experience or college degree is required. However, it’s also a great fit for developers looking to reskill or upskill in Java.
